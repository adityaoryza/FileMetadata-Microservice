# File Metadata Microservice

## Description :
The File Metadata Microservice is a simple web application built with Node.js and Express that allows users to upload files and retrieve some metadata about them. This project was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs certification.

The application provides an API endpoint that accepts a POST request with a file uploaded via a form and returns a JSON object with the file name, type, and size in bytes. The implementation uses the Multer middleware to handle the file upload and the 'request' object to extract the file information.

The front-end interface is built with Bootstrap and jQuery, and allows users to select a file from their local computer and upload it to the server. The UI displays the metadata of the uploaded file in a user-friendly format.

This application can be used as a reference or starting point for building similar microservices with Node.js and Express, and can be easily deployed on platforms like Heroku or Glitch.

Feel free to use this project as a learning resource or as a starting point for your own file upload and metadata projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
